Messenger is now used by 900 million people every month. With the launch of Send / Receive API, bots are about to [take](http://time.com/4291214/facebook-messenger-bots/) [over](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3055588/social-media/an-army-of-chatbots-will-take-over-facebook-here-s-why.html).

### Why?

I created JARVIS with two goals in mind:

1. It should have a lot of useful features (both fun and commonly used).
2. Anyone can contribute to this project. (As this is module-based, anybody with a decent knowledge of Python can contribute.) One of the prime goals of this project is to lower the entry barrier in the world of open source.

Take a look at the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/swapagarwal/JARVIS-on-Messenger/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how easy it is to add your code. I'll be waiting for your pull request! :wink:

### Usage

JARVIS is at your service [here](http://m.me/J.A.R.V.I.S.on.Messenger). Currently, it's pending approval before the public can engage. If you'd like to be a tester, post [here](https://www.facebook.com/J.A.R.V.I.S.on.Messenger/posts/551338921704902).

### Sample Queries

`Hi, Jarvis!`  
`Are you there?`  
`tell me a joke`  
`iron man movie`  
`define a superhero`  
`wiki html`  
`anything you want book`  
`random quote`  
`usd to eur rate`  
More examples can be found [here](https://github.com/swapagarwal/JARVIS-on-Messenger/tree/master/modules/tests).

### Local Development / Testing

1. Clone this repo.
2. `sudo apt-get install python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python jarvis.py`
5. Visit the following URLs to see results:  
`http://localhost:5000/process/?q=<YOUR_QUERY>` returns the intent of the query.  
`http://localhost:5000/search/?q=<YOUR_QUERY>` returns the search result of the query.

### History

I started out with rule-based model but it didn't scale well so now I've shifted to Natural Language Processing.
Rest assured, I'll strive to keep it as simple as possible so that you, yes you, can contribute!

If you'd like to contribute to the old model, you are welcome to do so as well.
I've created a new branch [`legacy`](https://github.com/swapagarwal/JARVIS-on-Messenger/tree/legacy) for this purpose. I'll be accepting Pull Requests to this branch also. :smile:

P.S. If you've come this far, you might as well contribute.

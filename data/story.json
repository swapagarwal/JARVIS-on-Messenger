        "Once, a hare saw a tortoise walking slowly with a heavy shell on his back. The hare was very proud of himself and he asked the tortoise. â€œShall we have a race?",
"The tortoise agreed. They started the running race. The hare ran very fast. But the tortoise walked very slowly. The proud hair rested under a tree and soon slept off. But the tortoise walked very fast, slowly and steadily and reached the goal. At last, the tortoise won the race."
